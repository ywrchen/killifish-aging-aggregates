The following four files were downloaded from OMIM on on March 26, 2019.
genemap2.txt
mim2gene.txt
mimTitles.txt
morbidmap.txt

To ease mapping of individual protein symbol to the phenotype (OMIM enntries), I split the alias of symbols into  multiple rows in the file called genemap2_melt.csv. This helps to merge dataframe for future id mapping uses.
